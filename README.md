## Introduction
### What is server composed of?
    compute - cpu
    memory - ram
    Storage Data - files or 
    Data stored in structured way - database
    Network: router, switches, dns server
### IT terminologies
    Network - bunch of cables, routers and servers connected with each other
    Router - A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.They where to send your packets on internet.
    Switch - Takes a packages and sends it to the correct server/client on your network
    if we put all the things together
        Our client will send the data to the router, the switch will know to which computer in your to send data.
### Problems with traditional IT approach
    Pay for the rent for the data center
    Pay for power supply, cooling, maintanance
    Adding and replacing hardware takes time
    Scaling is limited
    Hire 24/7 team to monitor the infrastructure
    How to deal with disasters? (earthquake, powershutdown, fire..)
    We can eliminate all this difficulties by using cloud.
### What is cloud computing
    Cloud computing is the on demand delivery of compute power, database storage, applications and other IT resources.
    Through cloud service platform pay-as-you-go pricing.
    We can provision exactly type and size of computing resources as you need.
    you can access as many resources as you need almost instantly.
    Gives simple way to access servers, storage, databases and a set of application services.
    AWS owns and maintains the network connected hardware required for these application services, while you provision and use what you need via web application.
### Types of clouds
    Private cloud
        Cloud services used by single organization, not exposed to public
        Complete control
        Security for sensitivity application
        Meet specific Business needs
    Public Cloud
        AWS, Azure, Google cloud
        Cloud service owned and operated by a third party cloud service provider delivered over internet.
        Six advantages of cloud computing
    Hybrid Cloud
        keep some servers on premises and extend some capabilities to the cloud.
        Control over sensitive assests in your private infrastructure.
        Flexibility and cost effectiveness of the public cloud.
### Five Characterists of Cloud
    On demand self service
        Users can provision resources and use them without human interaction from the service provider
    Broad network access
        Resources avaliable over the internet and can be accessable by diverse client platforms
    Multitenancy and resource pooling
        Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and application with security and privacy.
    Rapid elasticity and scalability
        Automatically and quickly acquire and dispose resources when needed.
        Quickly and easily scale based on demand
    Measured Service
        Usage is measured, users pay correctly what they have used.
